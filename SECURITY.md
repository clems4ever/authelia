# Security Policy

## Prologue

Authelia takes security very seriously. We follow the rule of
[responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure), and we urge our community to do so as
well instead of making the vulnerability public. This allows time for the security issue to be patched quickly.

If you discover a vulnerability in Authelia, please first contact one of the maintainers privately either via
[Matrix](#matrix), [Discord](#discord), or [email](#email) as described in the [contact options](#contact-options)
below. We urge you not to disclose the bug publicly at least until we've had a chance to fix it.

For more information about [security](https://www.authelia.com/docs/security/) related matters, please read
[the documentation](https://www.authelia.com/docs/security/).
