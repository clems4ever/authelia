**Authelia** supports Time-base one-time password generated by apps like [Google Authenticator].

</p>

After having successfully completed the first factor, select **One-Time Password method**
option and click on **Not registered yet?** link. This will e-mail you to confirm your identity.

*NOTE: If you're testing **Authelia**, this e-mail has likely been sent to the mailbox available at <https://mail.example.com:8080/>*

Once this validation step is completed, a QR Code gets displayed.

</p>

You can then use [Google Authenticator] to scan the code in order to register your device.

From now on, you get tokens generated every 30 seconds that
you can use to validate the second factor in **Authelia**.

## Limitations

Users currently can only enroll a single TOTP device in **Authelia**. Multiple single type device enrollment will be
available when [this issue](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/issues/275) has been resolved.
