## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

The following areas are actively being worked on for Kubernetes:

1. Detailed Documentaiton
2. [Helm Chart (v3)](https://github.com/authelia/chartrepo)
3. Kustomize Deployment
4. Manifest Examples

Users are welcome to reach out directly on our [Matrix Room](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#authelia:matrix.org) or
[Discord Server](https://discord.authelia.com) if they are looking for help setting up on Kubernetes in the meantime.

## FAQ

### RAM usage

If using file-based authentication, the argon2id provider will by default use 1GB of RAM for password generation. This
means you should allow for at least this amount in your deployment/daemonset spec and have this much available on your
node, alternatively you can [tweak the providers settings](https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/authentication/file.html#memory).
Otherwise, your Authelia may OOM during login. See [here](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/issues/1234#issuecomment-663910799)
for more info.
