## Docker Compose

### Steps

These commands are to be run sequentially:

- `git clone https://github.com/authelia/authelia.git`
- `cd authelia/examples/compose/local`
- ``git checkout $(git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`)``
- `./setup.sh` *sudo is required to modify the `/etc/hosts` file, the user will be prompted for access if not run as root*

You can now visit the following locations; replace example.com with the domain you specified in the setup script:

- <https://public.example.com> - Bypasses Authelia
- <https://traefik.example.com> - Secured with Authelia one-factor authentication
- <https://secure.example.com> - Secured with Authelia two-factor authentication (see note below)

You will need to authorize the self-signed certificate upon visiting each domain.
To visit <https://secure.example.com> you will need to register a device for second factor authentication and confirm by
clicking on a link sent by email. Since this is a demo with a fake email address, the content of the email will be stored
in `./authelia/notification.txt`. Upon registering, you can grab this link easily by running the following command:
`grep -Eo '"https://.*" ' ./authelia/notification.txt`.

## Deployment

So you're convinced that Authelia is what you need. You can head to the deployment documentation [here](./deployment/index.md).
Some recipes have been crafted for helping with the bootstrap of your environment. You can choose between a
[lite](./deployment/deployment-lite.md) deployment which is deployment advised for a single server setup. However, this
setup just does not scale. If you want a full environment that can scale out, use the [HA](./deployment/deployment-ha.md)
or [Kubernetes](./deployment/deployment-kubernetes.md) deployment documentation.
