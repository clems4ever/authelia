There are two ways to store the users along with their password:

- LDAP: users are stored in remote servers like OpenLDAP, OpenAM or Microsoft Active Directory.
- File: users are stored in YAML file with a hashed version of their password.

## Configuration

```yaml
authentication_backend:
  disable_reset_password: false
  file: {}
  ldap: {}
```

## Options

### disable_reset_password

<div markdown="1">
type: boolean
{: .label .label-config .label-purple }
default: false
{: .label .label-config .label-blue }
required: no
{: .label .label-config .label-green }
</div>

This setting controls if users can reset their password from the web frontend or not.

### file
