Here are the main customizable options in Authelia.

## Host & Port

```yaml
host: 0.0.0.0
port: 9091
```

### host

<div markdown="1">
type: string
{: .label .label-config .label-purple }
default: 0.0.0.0
{: .label .label-config .label-blue }
required: no
{: .label .label-config .label-green }
</div>

Defines the address to listen on. See also [port](#port). Should typically be `0.0.0.0` or `127.0.0.1`, the former for
containerized environments and the later for daemonized environments like init.d and systemd.

Note: If utilising an IPv6 literal address it must be enclosed by square brackets and quoted:

```yaml
host: "[fd00:1111:2222:3333::1]"
```

### port

<div markdown="1">
type: integer
{: .label .label-config .label-purple }
default: 9091
{: .label .label-config .label-blue }
required: no
{: .label .label-config .label-green }
</div>

Defines the port to listen on. See also [host](#host).

## TLS

Authelia's port typically listens for plain unencrypted connections. This is by design as most environments allow to
security on lower areas of the OSI model. However it required, if you specify both of the tls options the port will
listen for TLS connections.

```yaml
tls_key: /config/ssl/key.pem
tls_cert: /config/ssl/cert.pem
```

### tls_key

<div markdown="1">
type: string (path)
{: .label .label-config .label-purple }
default: ""
{: .label .label-config .label-blue }
required: situational
{: .label .label-config .label-yellow }
</div>

The path to the private key for TLS connections. Must be in DER base64/PEM format.

### tls_cert

<div markdown="1">
type: string (path)
{: .label .label-config .label-purple }
default: ""
{: .label .label-config .label-blue }
required: situational
{: .label .label-config .label-yellow }
</div>

The path to the public certificate for TLS connections. Must be in DER base64/PEM format.

## certificates_directory

This option defines the location of additional certificates to load into the trust chain specifically for Authelia.
This currently affects both the SMTP notifier and the LDAP authentication backend. The certificates should all be in the
PEM format and end with the extension `.pem`, `.crt`, or `.cer`. You can either add the individual certificates public
key or the CA public key which signed them (don't add the private key).

```yaml
certificates_directory: /config/certs/
```

## jwt_secret

<div markdown="1">
type: string
{: .label .label-config .label-purple }
default: ""
{: .label .label-config .label-blue }
required: yes
{: .label .label-config .label-red }
</div>

Defines the secret used to craft JWT tokens leveraged by the identity
verification process. This can also be defined using a [secret](./secrets.md).

```yaml
jwt_secret: v3ry_important_s3cr3t
```

## default_redirection_url

<div markdown="1">
type: string
{: .label .label-config .label-purple }
default: ""
{: .label .label-config .label-blue }
required: no
{: .label .label-config .label-green }
</div>

The default redirection URL is the URL where users are redirected when Authelia cannot detect the target URL where the
user was heading.

In a normal authentication workflow, a user tries to access a website and she gets redirected to the sign-in portal in
order to authenticate. Since the user initially targeted a website, the portal knows where the user was heading and
can redirect her after the authentication process. However, when a user visits the sign in portal directly, the portal
considers the targeted website is the portal. In that case and if the default redirection URL is configured, the user is
redirected to that URL. If not defined, the user is not redirected after authentication.

```yaml
default_redirection_url: https://home.example.com:8080/
```
